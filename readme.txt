6. About self-extract installer

 - v3.10 or later, self-extract installer format is supported.
   This format is install.exe with additional files.
   Additional files are "ipmsg.exe", "ipmsg.chm", "setup.exe".
   Additional file format is this.
 　 \n===(70 characters)===\n
 　 filesize filename\n
 　 (Zlib compressed file)

 - I have used this python script for generate self-extract installer.

=====================================================
import sys, zlib

def add_file(f, fname):
	data = zlib.compress(open(fname, "rb").read())
	f.write("\n%s\n" % ("=" * 70))
	f.write("%d %s\n" % (len(data), fname))
	f.write(data)

def gen_inst(installer_name, installer_base, files):
	f = open(installer_name, "wb")
	f.write(open(installer_base, "rb").read())
	for i in files:
		add_file(f, i)
	f.close()

gen_inst("ipmsgXXX_installer.exe", "install.exe", ["ipmsg.exe", "ipmsg.chm", "setup.exe"])
